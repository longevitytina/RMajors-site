          My life has been committed to discovering my passion and learning the
          best way to develop myself into the person I want to become. This has
          led me to a lot of humanitarian work and exposure to poorer
          communities, which includes my existing service to the poor in Las
          Vegas. The exposure I have had to the human need for sustainable
          housing is the source of my inspiration for my current endeavors in
          the study of engineering. I am an established resident of Nevada and a
          student at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Skilled in design
          practices, Microsoft Office, AutoCad, engineering and construction
          concepts. I fill roles of leadership and teamwork in the community and
          in organizations including Engineers Without Borders, the Las Vegas
          Catholic Worker, Tau Beta Pi Honor Society, the Nevada Desert
          Experience and the American Society of Civil Engineers. There are many
          projects that I am proud to be a part of and I encourage others to
          reach out to me if they are interested in working on a project
          together.
