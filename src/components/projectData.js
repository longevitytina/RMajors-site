    description:
      "Knowledge is a gift to the world and working with Engineers Without Borders allows gifted professionals to share their ability with countries that do not have the resources to meet necessary goals. Working with communities to create infrastructure, EWB engages student volunteers to help organize projects from their local campus. At the University of Nevada Las Vegas Chapter we are currently working on a school house to be built in Guatemala. The current cost for the project is $50,000 and we are always looking for ways to raise funds and volunteers that can help with the project. ",

The Martin Luther King  Jr Parade is a time for the community to take the streets and celebrate a life that was dedicated to equality and justice.

      "The Nevada Desert has a lot of history and much of its vast treasure is far from the large cities and bright lights. The Nevada Desert Experience has organized a sacred walk into the desert to honor the land and the people who have lived on it for centuries. During my time coordinating this event I have met various individuals from different backgrounds and faiths on this 60 mile pilgrimage. I recommend doing the Sacred Peace Walk once in your life. ",
